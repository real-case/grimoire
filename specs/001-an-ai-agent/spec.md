# Feature Specification: Word Information Service for EFL Learners

**Feature Branch**: `001-an-ai-agent`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "An AI agent that receives a word and provides comprehensive information about it. The information created should help students as best as possible in learning English as a foreign language."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Word Lookup (Priority: P1)

An English as a Foreign Language (EFL) student encounters an unfamiliar word while reading and needs to quickly understand its meaning, pronunciation, and basic usage to continue their studies.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of Grimoire - providing immediate, comprehensive word information. Without this, the system has no utility.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a single word (e.g., "serendipity") and verifying that the response includes definition, phonetics, usage examples, and grammatical information. Delivers immediate learning value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student encounters the word "ephemeral" while reading, **When** they query the word, **Then** they receive a complete definition with clear, learner-appropriate language
2. **Given** a student queries "run", **When** the system processes this common word, **Then** they receive multiple definitions covering different contexts (verb: to move quickly, to operate, to manage; noun: an act of running)
3. **Given** a student queries a word with irregular forms like "go", **When** they receive the information, **Then** they see the irregular verb forms (go-went-gone) highlighted
4. **Given** a student queries "beautiful", **When** they view the results, **Then** they see the phonetic transcription in IPA format (/ˈbjuːtɪfəl/) to help with pronunciation

### User Story 2 - Contextual Learning with Examples (Priority: P2)

An EFL student wants to see how a word is used in real sentences to understand its nuances and ensure they can use it correctly in their own writing and speaking.

**Why this priority**: Understanding definitions alone is insufficient for language learning. Students need context to use words appropriately and naturally.

**Independent Test**: Query a word like "ubiquitous" and verify that multiple natural usage examples are provided showing the word in different contexts, helping learners understand appropriate usage patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student queries "ambiguous", **When** they view usage examples, **Then** they see 3-5 sentences demonstrating the word in different contexts (academic, casual, business)
2. **Given** a student queries "get" (a highly context-dependent word), **When** they view examples, **Then** they see examples covering different meanings (obtain, understand, become, etc.)
3. **Given** a student is learning vocabulary for a specific domain, **When** they query technical words, **Then** they see examples appropriate to that context with domain-specific usage

---

### User Story 3 - Vocabulary Expansion with Synonyms and Related Words (Priority: P3)

An EFL student wants to expand their vocabulary by learning related words, synonyms, and antonyms to develop a richer understanding of the semantic field around a word.

**Why this priority**: Vocabulary building is enhanced when words are learned in semantic clusters. This helps students develop a more sophisticated command of English.

**Independent Test**: Query "happy" and verify that synonyms (joyful, content, pleased), antonyms (sad, unhappy, miserable), and related words (happiness, happily) are provided with context about usage differences.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student queries "fast", **When** they view synonyms, **Then** they see alternatives like "quick", "rapid", "swift" with guidance on subtle differences in usage
2. **Given** a student queries "cold", **When** they view antonyms, **Then** they see "hot", "warm", "heated" to understand the opposite meanings
3. **Given** a student queries "analyze", **When** they view related words, **Then** they see word family members (analysis, analytical, analyst) to understand morphological relationships

---

### User Story 4 - Proficiency-Appropriate Content (Priority: P4)

An EFL student wants to receive information at an appropriate difficulty level for their learning stage, helping them gradually progress from basic to advanced vocabulary.

**Why this priority**: Language learners benefit from understanding whether a word is essential for beginners or more appropriate for advanced learners. This helps with study prioritization.

**Independent Test**: Query both "cat" (beginner) and "photosynthesis" (advanced) and verify that difficulty levels are clearly indicated, helping students prioritize their learning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a beginner student queries "house", **When** they view the difficulty level, **Then** it's marked as "A1-A2" (beginner level) according to CEFR standards
2. **Given** an advanced student queries "conundrum", **When** they view the difficulty level, **Then** it's marked as "C1-C2" (advanced level)
3. **Given** a student queries "common", **When** they view frequency information, **Then** they see it's a high-frequency word (top 1000) essential for early learning

---

### User Story 5 - Grammatical Guidance (Priority: P5)

An EFL student needs grammatical information about a word to use it correctly, including plural forms, verb conjugations, and usage patterns.

**Why this priority**: Correct grammar is essential for effective communication. Students need to understand how words change in different grammatical contexts.

**Independent Test**: Query "child" and verify that the irregular plural "children" is shown, or query "swim" and verify that conjugations (swim-swam-swum) are provided.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student queries "mouse", **When** they view grammatical information, **Then** they see the irregular plural form "mice"
2. **Given** a student queries "write", **When** they view verb forms, **Then** they see all forms: base (write), past simple (wrote), past participle (written), present participle (writing), 3rd person singular (writes)
3. **Given** a student queries an adjective like "good", **When** they view grammatical information, **Then** they see comparative and superlative forms (good-better-best)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user queries a word that doesn't exist or is misspelled?
  - System should provide "Word not found" message
  - System should suggest close matches if possible (e.g., "Did you mean: 'receive'?" for "recieve")

- What happens when a word has multiple unrelated meanings (homographs like "lead" - metal vs. to guide)?
  - System should clearly separate different meanings with distinct definitions and examples

- What happens when a user queries very obscure or archaic words?
  - System should return available information with appropriate context (e.g., "archaic" or "rare" style tags)

- What happens when a user queries proper nouns or brand names?
  - System should indicate these are proper nouns and provide basic context if available

- What happens when phonetic information or certain attributes are unavailable for a word?
  - System should explicitly indicate missing information rather than omitting the field

## Assumptions

1. **Language Scope**: The system focuses exclusively on English language words (variants including US, UK, Australian English are included where differences exist)
2. **Data Sources**: The system will rely on authoritative linguistic databases and dictionaries (specific sources to be determined during implementation planning)
3. **Input Format**: Users will input a single word per query; multi-word phrases and sentences are out of scope for this feature
4. **Learner Proficiency**: The system serves learners at all proficiency levels (A1-C2), with content appropriately labeled but not filtered by user level
5. **Response Format**: Information is structured and consistently formatted across all queries
6. **Offline Capability**: Not required for initial version; system requires network connectivity
7. **Audio Pronunciation**: Not included in this version; phonetic text representation (IPA) is sufficient
8. **Etymology**: Not included in this version; focus is on contemporary usage for learners
9. **Idiomatic Expressions**: Single-word queries only; multi-word idioms are out of scope
10. **User Authentication**: Not required for basic word lookup functionality
