# Specification Quality Checklist: Word Information Service for EFL Learners

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Details**:
- Content Quality: All 4 items passed
  - Specification is free of implementation details
  - Focused on EFL learner needs and educational outcomes
  - Written in business/user language, not technical jargon
  - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) completed

- Requirement Completeness: All 8 items passed
  - No clarification markers needed - all requirements are clear
  - All 15 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - All 8 success criteria include specific metrics (time, percentages, counts)
  - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of specific tech)
  - 5 user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios
  - Edge cases cover error handling, ambiguous inputs, and missing data
  - Scope is clearly defined with explicit "Out of Scope" section
  - Assumptions section documents 10 clear assumptions

- Feature Readiness: All 4 items passed
  - Each functional requirement maps to user stories and acceptance criteria
  - User scenarios cover all primary flows from basic lookup to advanced features
  - Success criteria are measurable and aligned with user needs
  - No implementation details present (no mention of databases, APIs, frameworks)

**Ready for next phase**: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

- Specification is comprehensive and learner-focused
- Clear prioritization with P1-P5 user stories enables incremental delivery
- Success criteria are specific and measurable (e.g., "under 2 seconds", "95% of queries", "80% of cases")
- Edge cases well-defined for error handling and data quality
- Assumptions clearly document scope boundaries (English only, single words, no audio)
