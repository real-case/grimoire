# Tasks: Word Information Service for EFL Learners

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-an-ai-agent/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are optional for this feature. Tasks focus on implementation only.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below use single project structure from plan.md

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (P2): Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1 but independently testable
  - User Story 3 (P3): Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1 but independently testable
  - User Story 4 (P4): Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1 but independently testable
  - User Story 5 (P5): Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1 but independently testable
- **Edge Cases (Phase 8)**: Depends on US1 completion - Enhances core functionality
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: FOUNDATIONAL - All other stories build on basic word lookup
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Extends US1 with richer examples - independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Extends US1 with related words - independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Extends US1 with difficulty/frequency - independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Extends US1 with grammatical forms - independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services (T016-T022 before T024-T026)
- Services before endpoints (T034-T038 before T039-T043)
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T002-T009)
- All Model tasks in Foundational marked [P] can run in parallel (T016-T022, T027-T028, T031)
- Adapter implementations within a story marked [P] can run in parallel (T034-T036, T057-T058)
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members once Foundational is complete

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch all model definitions together:
Task: "Implement Word model in src/models/word.py"
Task: "Implement Definition model in src/models/definition.py"
Task: "Implement UsageExample model in src/models/usage_example.py"
Task: "Implement PhoneticRepresentation model in src/models/phonetic.py"
Task: "Implement GrammaticalInformation model in src/models/grammar.py"
Task: "Implement LearningMetadata model in src/models/learning_metadata.py"
Task: "Implement RelatedWord model in src/models/related_word.py"

# Then launch all Pydantic schemas together:
Task: "Create Pydantic request schemas in src/api/v1/models/requests.py"
Task: "Create Pydantic response schemas in src/api/v1/models/responses.py"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all adapters for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Implement ClaudeEnrichmentAdapter in src/services/claude_enrichment_adapter.py"
Task: "Implement WordNetAdapter in src/services/wordnet_adapter.py"
Task: "Implement CMUPhoneticAdapter in src/services/cmu_phonetic_adapter.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T009)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T010-T033) - CRITICAL checkpoint
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T034-T043)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Add Edge Cases ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
8. Add Polish ‚Üí Final deployment
9. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done (T033 complete):
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T034-T043)
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (T057-T063) - can start in parallel since it uses separate adapters
   - Developer C: User Story 5 (T064-T069) - enhances Claude adapter independently
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. User Stories 2 & 3 can proceed once US1 is complete

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests are optional for this feature - focus is on implementation
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- Constitution compliance: All tasks align with API-First Design, Data Quality, Response Completeness, Performance, and Extensibility principles
