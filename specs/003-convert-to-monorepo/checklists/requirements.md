# Specification Quality Checklist: Monorepo Conversion

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ Specification focuses on organizational structure and developer workflows without mandating specific implementation approaches
- ✅ Written from developer experience perspective (clear user personas)
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete
- ✅ Optional sections (Assumptions, Dependencies, Constraints, Out of Scope) appropriately included

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✅ All functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-002: "run API development server independently" can be verified by executing command)
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (SC-001: "under 30 seconds", SC-004: "at least 30% reduction")
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic and focused on outcomes (startup time, test isolation, setup time)
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format and are verifiable
- ✅ Edge cases cover critical migration concerns (conflicting dependencies, git history, Docker compatibility)
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded with Out of Scope section
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions explicitly documented

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios (FR-002/FR-003 → User Story 1, FR-004 → User Story 2, FR-009 → User Story 3)
- ✅ Three prioritized user scenarios (P1: Independent development, P2: Unified management, P3: CI/CD optimization)
- ✅ Success criteria measure feature effectiveness without referencing implementation (e.g., "developers can start in under 30 seconds" vs "Nx command executes quickly")
- ✅ No technology-specific details in specification (Nx mentioned in input but spec describes capabilities, not tool choices)

## Status

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan` or direct implementation planning.

No clarifications needed - all requirements have reasonable defaults based on standard monorepo practices.
