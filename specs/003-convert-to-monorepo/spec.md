# Feature Specification: Monorepo Conversion

**Feature Branch**: `003-convert-to-monorepo`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Convert to monorepo. Convert the project to a monorepo. The API and UI should be in separate folders within the same repository. It should be possible to run them independently. Use Nx for managing them"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Independent Application Development (Priority: P1)

Developers need to work on the API or UI independently without affecting the other application. They should be able to run, build, test, and deploy each application in isolation while maintaining the benefits of a shared repository.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the monorepo conversion. Without independent operation, the migration provides no benefit and could create development bottlenecks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running API development server without UI dependencies, and vice versa. Delivers immediate value by enabling parallel team workflows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer wants to work on the API, **When** they run the API development server, **Then** it starts successfully without requiring UI dependencies or build steps
2. **Given** a developer wants to work on the UI, **When** they run the UI development server, **Then** it starts successfully without requiring API dependencies or build steps
3. **Given** a developer wants to run API tests, **When** they execute the API test suite, **Then** tests run in isolation without UI code interference
4. **Given** a developer wants to run UI tests, **When** they execute the UI test suite, **Then** tests run in isolation without API code interference

### User Story 2 - Unified Dependency and Build Management (Priority: P2)

Developers need a single source of truth for managing dependencies, build configurations, and tooling across both applications. They should be able to install all dependencies with one command and have consistent tooling configurations.

**Why this priority**: Reduces configuration drift and simplifies onboarding. Critical for long-term maintainability but not required for day-one functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a single install command and verifying both applications have all required dependencies. Delivers value by reducing setup complexity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new developer clones the repository, **When** they run the root installation command, **Then** all dependencies for both API and UI are installed correctly
2. **Given** a developer updates a shared dependency, **When** they commit the change, **Then** both applications use the updated dependency version
3. **Given** a developer runs linting from the root, **When** the command executes, **Then** both applications are linted with consistent rules
4. **Given** a developer needs to understand project structure, **When** they view the workspace configuration, **Then** they can clearly see all applications, their dependencies, and relationships

---

### User Story 3 - Efficient CI/CD with Affected Detection (Priority: P3)

The CI/CD system needs to intelligently detect which applications are affected by code changes and only run relevant builds and tests. This reduces pipeline execution time and resource usage.

**Why this priority**: Optimization that provides significant long-term value but isn't critical for initial development workflows. Can be implemented after core monorepo structure is stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making API-only changes and verifying UI builds/tests are skipped in CI. Delivers value by reducing pipeline costs and developer wait times.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer changes only API code, **When** CI pipeline runs, **Then** only API builds and tests execute
2. **Given** a developer changes only UI code, **When** CI pipeline runs, **Then** only UI builds and tests execute
3. **Given** a developer changes shared configuration, **When** CI pipeline runs, **Then** both API and UI builds and tests execute
4. **Given** a developer wants to verify local changes, **When** they run affected command locally, **Then** they see which applications will be tested in CI

### Edge Cases

- What happens when API and UI have conflicting dependency versions (e.g., different TypeScript versions)?
- How does the system handle migrating existing git history and branch workflows?
- What happens when developers need to create shared libraries between API and UI?
- How does the system handle environment variables and secrets that differ between applications?
- What happens when one application fails to build but the other succeeds?
- How are Docker builds affected by the monorepo structure?
- What happens to existing deployment workflows and infrastructure configurations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Repository MUST organize API and UI code into separate workspace applications with clear boundaries
- **FR-002**: Developers MUST be able to run API development server independently using a single command
- **FR-003**: Developers MUST be able to run UI development server independently using a single command
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a single root installation command that configures all dependencies for both applications
- **FR-005**: Each application MUST maintain its own build, test, and lint configurations
- **FR-006**: System MUST support running API tests without building or loading UI code
- **FR-007**: System MUST support running UI tests without building or loading API code
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide commands to build each application independently
- **FR-009**: System MUST detect and report which applications are affected by code changes
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve existing API functionality (FastAPI, Python dependencies, database migrations)
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve existing UI functionality (Next.js, React, Prisma, Tailwind)
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing Docker and docker-compose configurations
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide clear documentation showing how to run each application independently
- **FR-014**: Developers MUST be able to run linting and formatting across all applications from the root
- **FR-015**: System MUST support creating shared libraries that both applications can consume

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Workspace**: The root monorepo containing multiple applications and shared configuration
- **API Application**: Python FastAPI application with its own dependencies, tests, and build configuration
- **UI Application**: Next.js TypeScript application with its own dependencies, tests, and build configuration
- **Shared Libraries**: Optional code packages that both API and UI can import (future extensibility)
- **Workspace Configuration**: Nx configuration defining applications, dependencies, and task orchestration

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can start API development server in under 30 seconds without UI dependencies
- **SC-002**: Developers can start UI development server in under 30 seconds without API dependencies
- **SC-003**: Full repository setup (clone + install) completes in under 5 minutes on standard development machines
- **SC-004**: CI pipeline execution time reduces by at least 30% for single-application changes through affected detection
- **SC-005**: All existing API tests pass without modification after monorepo conversion
- **SC-006**: All existing UI tests pass without modification after monorepo conversion
- **SC-007**: Docker builds complete successfully for both applications after monorepo conversion
- **SC-008**: New developers can understand project structure and run both applications within 15 minutes using documentation
- **SC-009**: Zero breaking changes to existing development workflows (commands may change but capabilities remain)

## Assumptions

- **A-001**: Nx is the preferred monorepo management tool (explicitly stated in requirements)
- **A-002**: Both applications will continue using their current technology stacks (Python/FastAPI for API, TypeScript/Next.js for UI)
- **A-003**: Existing git history and branches should be preserved during migration
- **A-004**: Developers have Node.js installed (required for Nx even though API is Python-based)
- **A-005**: Current package managers (pip for Python, Yarn for JavaScript) will be preserved and integrated with Nx task orchestration
- **A-006**: Existing CI/CD workflows will need updates but should maintain current deployment targets
- **A-007**: Database configurations (PostgreSQL, Prisma, Alembic) remain unchanged
- **A-008**: Environment variable management will be standardized across applications
- **A-009**: The migration should be reversible if critical issues are discovered

## Out of Scope

- Merging API and UI into a single application
- Creating shared code libraries between API and UI in this phase (structure supports it for future)
- Modifying application functionality or features
- Changing technology stacks or frameworks
- Migrating to different package managers (keeping pip for Python, Yarn for JavaScript)
- Changing database schemas or migration strategies
- Implementing new CI/CD platforms (will update existing workflows)
- Performance optimizations beyond affected detection

## Dependencies

- **D-001**: Node.js and npm/yarn must be installed on all development machines
- **D-002**: Python 3.12+ must remain available for API development
- **D-003**: Existing Docker and docker-compose configurations must be compatible with new structure
- **D-004**: CI/CD platform must support monorepo task execution patterns
- **D-005**: All developers must have clean working directories before migration (no uncommitted changes)

## Constraints

- **C-001**: Migration must be completed on a feature branch with full testing before merging to main
- **C-002**: All existing tests must pass in the new structure without modification
- **C-003**: Migration should not require changes to production deployment configurations until verified
- **C-004**: Development workflows should remain familiar to existing team members
- **C-005**: Build times for individual applications should not increase compared to current setup
