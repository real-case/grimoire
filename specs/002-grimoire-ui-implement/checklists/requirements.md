# Specification Quality Checklist: Grimoire UI - Word Lookup and Editing Interface

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Details**:

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ The spec contains no implementation details - focuses on what users need to do (lookup, edit, save) without mentioning specific technologies
- ✅ All language is user-centric and describes business value (e.g., "personal vocabulary collection", "learning needs")
- ✅ Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete with substantial content

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present in the specification
- ✅ All 12 functional requirements are specific and testable (e.g., FR-001 specifies "text input field", FR-008 specifies "prevent duplicate entries")
- ✅ All 7 success criteria include measurable metrics (time limits, percentages, counts)
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic: focused on user outcomes (e.g., "Users can look up a word and view results in under 3 seconds") rather than technical metrics
- ✅ All 4 user stories include detailed acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
- ✅ Edge cases section identifies 6 specific boundary conditions and error scenarios
- ✅ Scope is clearly bounded to single-word lookup with edit and save functionality
- ✅ Dependencies section explicitly identifies the API dependency and database requirements; Assumptions section documents 7 specific assumptions

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✅ All 12 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ User scenarios cover the complete primary flow: lookup (US1) → edit (US2) → save (US3) plus error handling (US4)
- ✅ Feature aligns with all 7 measurable success criteria defined
- ✅ No leakage of implementation details - spec remains focused on user needs and outcomes

## Notes

The specification is complete and ready for the next phase. All quality criteria have been met without requiring any updates to the spec content.
