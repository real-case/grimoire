# Feature Specification: Grimoire UI - Word Lookup and Editing Interface

**Feature Branch**: `002-grimoire-ui-implement`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "grimoire-ui Implement a UI that does the following: The user enters a word and receives information about it from the API. They can then edit the results before saving the word to the database."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-18

- Q: When the API returns partial data (some fields missing), how should the UI handle display? → A: Display all available fields; show "Not available" or placeholder text for missing fields
- Q: What happens if the user tries to save a word without making any edits and it already exists in their database? → A: Allow the save; show the same duplicate indicator as when looking up an existing word
- Q: What happens when the user edits a field to be empty - is this allowed? → A: Allow empty values; user can clear any field if they don't need that information
- Q: How does the system handle very long words or extremely lengthy definitions? → A: Display full content with scrollable container if needed
- Q: How are special characters, diacritics, and non-English characters handled in word input? → A: Accept all Unicode characters; allow diacritics, accents, and non-English letters

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Word Lookup (Priority: P1)

A user wants to look up information about an English word to understand its definition, pronunciation, usage examples, and other linguistic properties before adding it to their personal vocabulary collection.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - enabling users to discover comprehensive word information. Without this, the feature provides no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering a valid English word and verifying that comprehensive word information is displayed to the user, including definitions, pronunciation guides, examples, and other relevant linguistic data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is on the word lookup page, **When** they enter a valid English word and submit, **Then** the system displays comprehensive information about the word including definitions, pronunciation, part of speech, and usage examples
2. **Given** the user has entered a word, **When** the API successfully returns word data, **Then** all available information fields are displayed in an organized, readable format
3. **Given** the user enters a word that exists in multiple forms (e.g., noun and verb), **When** the results are displayed, **Then** all relevant forms and their definitions are shown

---

### User Story 2 - Edit Word Information (Priority: P2)

A user wants to customize or correct the word information retrieved from the API before saving it, allowing them to add personal notes, simplify definitions, or adjust details to match their learning needs.

**Why this priority**: This differentiates the tool from a simple dictionary lookup by allowing personalization. It's essential for users who want to customize vocabulary for their specific learning context.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by retrieving word information and verifying that all displayed fields can be edited inline, with changes preserved when saving to the database.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** word information is displayed, **When** the user clicks on any editable field, **Then** the field becomes editable and the user can modify its content
2. **Given** the user has edited one or more fields, **When** they navigate away or start a new search, **Then** the system prompts them to save or discard changes
3. **Given** the user has made edits, **When** they review the modified information, **Then** edited fields are visually distinguished from original API data

---

### User Story 3 - Save to Personal Database (Priority: P1)

A user wants to save word information (either original or edited) to their personal vocabulary database so they can review, study, and track the words they're learning.

**Why this priority**: This completes the core user journey from lookup to persistence. Without saving, users cannot build their personal vocabulary collection, which is the fundamental purpose of the application.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by looking up a word, optionally editing it, saving it to the database, and verifying that it persists and can be retrieved later.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has word information displayed (original or edited), **When** they click the save button, **Then** the word is saved to their personal database and a confirmation message is displayed
2. **Given** the user attempts to save a word, **When** the save operation completes successfully, **Then** the word becomes available in their saved vocabulary list
3. **Given** the user has already saved a word, **When** they look up the same word again, **Then** the system indicates that this word already exists in their collection

---

### User Story 4 - Error Handling for Invalid Words (Priority: P2)

A user enters a word that doesn't exist in the API's database or contains invalid characters, and they need clear feedback about why no results were found and what they can do next.

**Why this priority**: Good error handling prevents user frustration and abandonment. While not core functionality, it's essential for a polished user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by entering various invalid inputs (misspellings, gibberish, special characters) and verifying appropriate error messages are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user enters a non-existent word, **When** the API returns no results, **Then** a friendly error message explains that the word was not found and suggests checking spelling
2. **Given** the user enters invalid characters or an empty string, **When** they attempt to submit, **Then** the system provides immediate feedback about the invalid input
3. **Given** the API is unavailable or returns an error, **When** the lookup fails, **Then** the user sees a clear error message explaining the issue and suggesting retry

---

### Edge Cases

- **Partial API data**: When the API returns incomplete data (missing fields), the UI displays all standard fields with "Not available" placeholder text for missing values, maintaining consistent layout
- **Duplicate save without edits**: If user attempts to save a word that already exists in their vocabulary without making any edits, the system shows the same duplicate indicator as during lookup (per FR-008), maintaining consistent behavior
- **Empty field editing**: Users are allowed to clear any field to empty values, supporting full personalization of word information
- **Long content handling**: Very long words or lengthy definitions are displayed in full with scrollable containers as needed to prevent layout breaking
- **Special characters and Unicode**: Input accepts all Unicode characters including diacritics, accents, and non-English letters to support international word lookups
- **Network connectivity loss**: When network connectivity is lost during lookup or save operations, the system displays appropriate error messages as defined in User Story 4

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a text input field where users can enter a single word to look up
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve word information from the existing API when a user submits a word
- **FR-003**: System MUST display all available word information fields returned by the API in an organized, readable format with scrollable containers for long content
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to edit any displayed information field before saving, including clearing fields to empty values
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a save action that persists the word information (original or edited) to the database
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide visual feedback during API calls (loading states)
- **FR-007**: System MUST display clear error messages when word lookup fails or returns no results
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent duplicate entries by indicating when a word already exists in the user's database
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve user edits if they navigate away before saving, or provide a clear warning about losing unsaved changes
- **FR-010**: System MUST visually distinguish between original API data and user-edited content
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide confirmation when a word is successfully saved to the database
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate input to prevent submission of empty word entries while accepting all Unicode characters including diacritics and non-English letters
- **FR-013**: System MUST display placeholder text (e.g., "Not available") for any missing fields when API returns partial data, maintaining consistent layout across all word displays

### Key Entities

- **Word Entry**: Represents a single word with its associated information including definition(s), pronunciation, part of speech, usage examples, etymology, synonyms, antonyms, difficulty level, and other linguistic metadata. Can exist in two states: "retrieved from API" (original) and "edited by user" (modified).
- **User Edits**: Tracks which fields of a word entry have been modified by the user, preserving both original and edited values for potential comparison or audit purposes.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can look up a word and view results in under 3 seconds for 95% of queries
- **SC-002**: Users can successfully complete the full workflow (lookup, edit, save) in under 60 seconds
- **SC-003**: 90% of valid word lookups return comprehensive information from the API
- **SC-004**: Error messages are displayed within 1 second of an error condition occurring
- **SC-005**: Users can edit and save at least 10 different information fields for any word
- **SC-006**: The interface prevents 100% of attempts to save duplicate words with clear feedback
- **SC-007**: 95% of users successfully complete their first word lookup and save on the first attempt without assistance

## Assumptions

- The word information API already exists and is functional (based on project context showing feature 001-an-ai-agent implemented this)
- The API returns structured data that can be displayed and edited field-by-field
- Users will primarily look up one word at a time (not bulk operations)
- The database schema supports storing word entries with multiple fields
- Standard web browser capabilities are sufficient (no mobile-specific requirements specified)
- Users have basic familiarity with form-based web interfaces
- English language words are the primary use case (though system should gracefully handle other inputs)

## Dependencies

- Requires the word information API to be operational (from feature 001-an-ai-agent)
- Requires database access to store and retrieve word entries
- May require user authentication/session management to associate saved words with specific users
