# Grimoire Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. API-First Design

Every feature MUST be exposed through a well-defined API interface before implementation.

- API contracts MUST be documented before code is written
- All endpoints MUST follow consistent request/response patterns
- APIs MUST be versioned to support backward compatibility
- Input validation MUST be performed at the API boundary
- Error responses MUST follow a standard format with clear error codes

**Rationale**: Grimoire is a service that provides word information. An API-first
approach ensures the system is consumable by various clients (CLI, web, mobile) and
maintains clear boundaries between interface and implementation.

### II. Data Quality & Accuracy

Linguistic data MUST be accurate, sourced from reliable references, and validated.

- All definitions MUST be verified against authoritative sources
- Phonetic transcriptions MUST follow IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) standards
- Usage examples MUST demonstrate actual, natural language patterns
- Grammatical information MUST be complete and correct
- Data sources MUST be documented and traceable

**Rationale**: Users depend on Grimoire for accurate language information. Incorrect
data undermines trust and utility. Quality is non-negotiable for a reference tool.

### III. Response Completeness

Word queries MUST return comprehensive information as specified in the feature scope.

- Responses MUST include all available fields: definition, phonetics, usage, grammar,
  synonyms, antonyms, difficulty, frequency, style tags, and related words
- Missing data MUST be explicitly indicated (null/absent) rather than silently omitted
- Partial results MUST be accompanied by clear indicators of what is incomplete
- Response schemas MUST be consistent across all word types

**Rationale**: Grimoire's value proposition is comprehensive word information. Partial
or inconsistent responses reduce utility and create confusion about data availability.

### IV. Performance & Efficiency

Word lookups MUST complete within acceptable time bounds to ensure good UX.

- API responses MUST complete within 500ms for cached entries (p95)
- API responses MUST complete within 2000ms for non-cached entries (p95)
- The system MUST implement caching for frequently accessed words
- Database queries MUST be optimized with appropriate indexes
- Rate limiting MUST be implemented to protect service availability

**Rationale**: Users expect reference tools to be fast. Slow responses interrupt
workflows and degrade the user experience, especially for applications that integrate
Grimoire for real-time suggestions or lookups.

### V. Extensibility

The system MUST be designed to accommodate new data sources and features.

- Data models MUST support schema evolution without breaking changes
- New linguistic attributes MUST be addable without requiring major refactoring
- The system MUST support pluggable data source adapters
- Feature additions MUST not compromise existing functionality

**Rationale**: Language is rich and evolving. Grimoire must adapt to new requirements
(e.g., adding etymology, regional variations, collocations) without requiring complete
rewrites.

## Quality Standards

### Testing Requirements

- **Contract Tests**: MUST verify API request/response schemas match documentation
- **Data Validation Tests**: MUST verify accuracy of sample word lookups against
  known correct results
- **Performance Tests**: MUST verify response time requirements are met under load
- **Integration Tests**: MUST verify end-to-end word lookup flows work correctly

### Documentation Requirements

- API endpoints MUST be documented with request/response examples
- Data source attributions MUST be maintained in documentation
- Setup and deployment procedures MUST be documented in README or docs/
- Configuration options MUST be documented with examples

### Code Quality

- Code MUST pass linting and formatting checks before merge
- Functions MUST have clear, single responsibilities
- Magic values MUST be extracted to named constants or configuration
- Complex logic MUST include explanatory comments

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process

1. **Specification**: Feature requirements documented in `specs/[###-feature]/spec.md`
2. **API Design**: API contracts defined in `specs/[###-feature]/contracts/`
3. **Test-First**: Write tests for expected behavior before implementation
4. **Implementation**: Build feature to pass tests and meet requirements
5. **Documentation**: Update API docs, README, and quickstart guides as needed
6. **Review**: Code review verifies adherence to constitution and quality standards

### Constitution Compliance

All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify:

- API-first principle: Are contracts defined and documented?
- Data quality: Are sources reliable and data validated?
- Completeness: Do responses include all required fields?
- Performance: Do lookups meet time requirements?
- Extensibility: Can this be extended without breaking changes?

Violations MUST be justified in the implementation plan's Complexity Tracking section
if absolutely necessary, with clear rationale for why simpler alternatives are
insufficient.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

1. Proposed amendments MUST be documented with clear rationale
2. Amendments MUST be reviewed for impact on existing principles
3. Version number MUST be incremented following semantic versioning:
   - MAJOR: Removal or redefinition of core principles
   - MINOR: Addition of new principles or sections
   - PATCH: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic changes
4. Template files MUST be updated to reflect constitutional changes
5. Existing features MUST be evaluated for compliance with amended principles

### Version Control

This constitution uses semantic versioning. Changes MUST update:

- `CONSTITUTION_VERSION`
- `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` to date of change (ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD)
- Sync Impact Report (HTML comment at top of file)

### Compliance Reviews

- Constitution checks MUST be performed during the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
- The implementation plan MUST document any principle violations and justifications
- Recurring reviews SHOULD be performed quarterly to ensure ongoing compliance
